# Introduction
This document defines the unified fullstack architecture for Flix, covering frontend apps, backend services, shared packages, and operational infrastructure. It is based on `docs/prd.md` and the current monorepo scaffold. No `docs/front-end-spec.md` was found at this stage, so frontend details are derived from PRD UI goals and current constraints.

## Starter Template or Existing Project
N/A - Greenfield project (custom monorepo scaffold already initialized).
