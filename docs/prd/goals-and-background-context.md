# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver a complete MVP for infoproduct creators to launch and manage course journeys end-to-end.
- Provide a premium streaming-like learning experience with release-window control per lesson.
- Centralize admin operations (events, lessons, materials, quizzes) in a single platform.
- Ensure consistent UI foundations across public and admin apps through a shared design-system package.

## Background Context
Flix addresses a common operational gap for infoproduct creators: course launch workflows are usually fragmented across multiple tools for hosting, release scheduling, student experience, and assessments. This increases setup complexity and creates inconsistent learner journeys.

The product direction is to provide a unified platform where admins can configure events and lesson timelines, while learners consume content in a streaming-inspired interface with clear release status, lesson progression, and supporting resources. The project already established a monorepo baseline and a migration path for a canonical design-system package.
