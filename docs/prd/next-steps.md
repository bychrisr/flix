# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
Use `docs/prd.md` and `docs/project-brief.md` to produce a high-level UI architecture and design direction for Flix (admin + learner flows), including core screens, interaction patterns, responsive behavior, and component priorities aligned to the monorepo structure.

## Architect Prompt
Use `docs/prd.md`, `docs/project-brief.md`, and the current monorepo scaffold to produce the technical architecture document, including backend modular design, API contracts, data model evolution plan, testing strategy, and implementation sequencing by epic/story.
