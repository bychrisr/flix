executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As an admin**,  
**I want to schedule lesson release and optional expiration dates**,  
**so that content availability follows launch strategy**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Admin can create, update, list, and delete lessons linked to an event.
2. Release datetime is required and expiration datetime is optional.
3. Business validation rejects invalid date windows.
