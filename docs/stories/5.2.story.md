# Story 5.2: Responsive Quality Pass

## Status
Draft

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a learner and admin**,  
**I want core workflows usable across desktop/tablet/mobile**,  
**so that platform value is maintained on all target devices**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Core screens meet responsive layout expectations for web breakpoints.
2. Navigation and form interactions remain usable on mobile.
3. Playback and catalog views preserve clarity across breakpoints.
