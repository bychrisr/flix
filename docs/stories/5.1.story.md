# Story 5.1: Canonical Design-System Token Adoption

## Status
Review

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a product team**,  
**I want canonical token usage from `packages/design-system`**,  
**so that UI consistency scales across web and admin apps**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Color/typography/foundation tokens are consumed from canonical package.
2. Legacy `design-system/` folder is treated as reference-only input.
3. Token usage replaces ad-hoc hardcoded styling in core screens.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1) Color/typography/foundation tokens are consumed from canonical package
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2) Legacy `design-system/` folder is treated as reference-only input
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3) Token usage replaces ad-hoc hardcoded styling in core screens
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 3

### Debug Log References
- No dedicated debug log file generated for this story.

### Completion Notes List
- Migrated canonical token set to `packages/design-system` (`colors`, `typography`, `foundations`).
- Added canonical `theme.css` token surface for direct app consumption.
- Added policy doc to treat `design-system/` as reference-only input.
- Updated package exports to expose `./tokens` and `./tokens/theme.css`.
