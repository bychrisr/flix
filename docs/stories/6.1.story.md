# Story 6.1: Database Schema, Migrations, and Seed Baseline

## Status
Draft

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@data-engineer"
quality_gate: "@dev"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a** platform engineer,  
**I want** a reproducible database schema and seed process,  
**so that** local and shared environments start from a consistent persistent state.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Database schema for events, lessons, materials, quizzes, and auth context is defined and versioned.
2. Migration commands can apply schema changes deterministically in a clean environment.
3. Seed process provides minimum runnable data set for admin and learner journeys.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1) Database schema for events, lessons, materials, quizzes, and auth context is defined and versioned.
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2) Migration commands can apply schema changes deterministically in a clean environment.
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3) Seed process provides minimum runnable data set for admin and learner journeys.
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 3
