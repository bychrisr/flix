# Story 7.1: Admin App Runtime Bootstrap and Auth Shell

## Status
Done

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a** admin,  
**I want** a real admin application shell with authentication,  
**so that** I can securely access operational workflows from the browser.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Admin app has runnable framework runtime and environment-based API configuration.
2. Login flow integrates with existing admin auth endpoint and stores session context safely.
3. Protected admin routes block unauthenticated access and handle expired sessions.
