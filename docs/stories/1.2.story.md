# Story 1.2: API Skeleton and Health Contract

## Status
Review

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a platform engineer**,  
**I want an API service skeleton with health contract**,  
**so that we have a deployable backend slice from the first epic**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. API service exposes a health endpoint with deterministic success response.
2. Request parsing, error handling middleware, and route module structure are in place.
3. Health endpoint is covered by an integration test.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1) API service exposes a health endpoint with deterministic success response
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2) Request parsing, error handling middleware, and route module structure are in place
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3) Health endpoint is covered by an integration test
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 3

## Testing
- Follow test pyramid and organization from architecture testing strategy.
  [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Testing Strategy]
- Add/update unit tests for new business logic.
- Add/update integration tests for modified API flows when applicable.
- Ensure critical journey impact is considered for E2E smoke coverage.

### Debug Log References
- No dedicated debug log file generated for this story.

### Completion Notes List
- Added Fastify app bootstrap with route registration and centralized error handler.
- Implemented deterministic `GET /health` contract with stable `status` and `service` fields.
- Structured API routes under dedicated modules (`health`, `admin-auth`, `events`).
- Added integration test for health endpoint and validated via `npm run test --workspace @flix/api`.
