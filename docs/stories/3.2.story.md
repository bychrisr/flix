# Story 3.2: Release-Window Access Enforcement

## Status
Draft

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a platform owner**,  
**I want server-authoritative release checks for lesson access**,  
**so that learners cannot bypass content gating rules**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Access endpoint returns consistent authorization based on release/expiry windows.
2. Locked and expired lessons are blocked from playback route access.
3. User-facing status messaging is returned for blocked scenarios.
4. Private event access rules are validated together with release-window checks.
