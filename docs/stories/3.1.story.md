# Story 3.1: Public Event Landing and Catalog

## Status
Done

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a learner**,  
**I want to browse an event and its lessons in a clear catalog**,  
**so that I can understand available and upcoming content**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Event landing displays hero content and lesson catalog.
2. Each lesson card displays status: released, locked, or expired.
3. Catalog rendering consumes API data and handles empty/error states.
4. Private events require successful access validation before catalog rendering.

### Debug Log References
- No dedicated debug log file generated for this story.

### Completion Notes List
- Added public catalog endpoint `POST /api/public/events/:eventSlug/catalog`.
- Endpoint returns event hero data plus lesson catalog payload.
- Added server-side status mapping for lesson cards (`released`, `locked`, `expired`).
- Added empty-catalog response (`isEmpty`) and standard 404/403 error handling.
- Added private-event access validation using event access key prior to catalog rendering.

- services/api/tests/integration/public-catalog.test.js

## QA Results
- PASS: `npm run test --workspace @flix/api`
- PASS: `npm run test --workspaces --if-present`
