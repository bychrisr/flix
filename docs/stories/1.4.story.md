# Story 1.4: Security and Validation Baseline

## Status
Draft

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a platform owner**,  
**I want baseline security controls active from day one**,  
**so that MVP features are built on a safe foundation**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Input validation is enforced for write endpoints.
2. CORS and rate-limit policies are configurable by environment.
3. Security headers baseline is enabled in production profile.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2) CORS and rate-limit policies are configurable by environment
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3) Security headers baseline is enabled in production profile
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 3
