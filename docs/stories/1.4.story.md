## Status
Review

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a platform owner**,  
**I want baseline security controls active from day one**,  
**so that MVP features are built on a safe foundation**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Input validation is enforced for write endpoints.
2. CORS and rate-limit policies are configurable by environment.
3. Security headers baseline is enabled in production profile.

- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1) Input validation is enforced for write endpoints
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2) CORS and rate-limit policies are configurable by environment
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3) Security headers baseline is enabled in production profile
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 3

## Testing
- Follow test pyramid and organization from architecture testing strategy.
  [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Testing Strategy]
- Add/update unit tests for new business logic.
- Add/update integration tests for modified API flows when applicable.
- Ensure critical journey impact is considered for E2E smoke coverage.

### Completion Notes List
- Added input validation on write endpoint (`POST /api/admin/login`) using Zod schema parsing.
- Added environment-driven CORS allowlist and global rate limiting plugin registration.
- Added production-only security headers baseline with Helmet.
- Added/validated integration coverage around successful and failing auth flows impacted by validation/security layer.
- Verified baseline with `npm run test --workspace @flix/api`.
