# Story 8.3: Browser E2E Smoke and CI Quality Gate Expansion

## Status
Draft

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@devops"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a** delivery team,  
**I want** browser-level smoke automation integrated into readiness gates,  
**so that** regressions in real user journeys are blocked before release.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. E2E smoke suite covers core admin and learner happy paths in browser runtime.
2. CI/release gate includes frontend build checks and E2E smoke execution.
3. Gate fails explicitly on critical flow breakage with actionable diagnostics.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1) E2E smoke suite covers core admin and learner happy paths in browser runtime.
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2) CI/release gate includes frontend build checks and E2E smoke execution.
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3) Gate fails explicitly on critical flow breakage with actionable diagnostics.
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 3
