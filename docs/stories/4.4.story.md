## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
GPT-5 Codex (CLI)

### Debug Log References
- No dedicated debug log file generated for this story.

### Completion Notes List
- Added learner-safe quiz read endpoint `POST /api/public/events/:eventSlug/lessons/:lessonSlug/quiz`.
- Added quiz submission endpoint `POST /api/public/events/:eventSlug/lessons/:lessonSlug/quiz/submit`.
- Submission flow validates answer payload, computes score percentage, and returns pass/fail status.
- Result payload includes lesson/quiz context plus summary fields (`correctAnswers`, `scorePercentage`, `status`).
- Access checks remain server-authoritative for private events and lesson release windows.

### File List
