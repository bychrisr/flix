# Story 8.1: Gemini Branding Adapter and API Flow

## Status
Draft

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a** admin,  
**I want** Gemini-based branding generation integrated via backend adapter,  
**so that** logo/branding assets can be generated inside the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Backend provides provider-agnostic branding service with Gemini adapter as initial implementation.
2. Branding generation endpoint validates inputs, handles retry/timeout/fallback, and returns standardized responses.
3. Generated branding assets can be persisted and linked to event visual metadata.
