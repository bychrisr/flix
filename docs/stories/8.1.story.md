# Story 8.1: Gemini Branding Adapter and API Flow

## Status

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"

## Story
**As a** admin,  
**I want** Gemini-based branding generation integrated via backend adapter,  
**so that** logo/branding assets can be generated inside the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Backend provides provider-agnostic branding service with Gemini adapter as initial implementation.
2. Branding generation endpoint validates inputs, handles retry/timeout/fallback, and returns standardized responses.
3. Generated branding assets can be persisted and linked to event visual metadata.

## Dev Agent Record
### Agent Model Used
GPT-5 Codex

### Debug Log References
- `npm run test --workspace @flix/api`

### Completion Notes List
- Implemented provider-agnostic branding service with adapter registry and Gemini adapter as default provider.
- Added admin endpoint `POST /api/events/:eventId/branding/generate` with payload validation and standardized response contract.
- Implemented timeout, retry with exponential backoff, and deterministic fallback generation strategy.
- Added branding metadata persistence on event model (`logoUrl`, `brandingProvider`, `brandingPromptVersion`, `brandingGeneratedAt`) and linked generated results with `hero` and `visualStyle`.
- Added database migration to persist branding metadata in SQLite.
- Added integration tests for provider flow, validation, retry/fallback behavior, and error surface without fallback.

## QA Results
PASS

- API integration suite passed (`17` files, `33` tests).
- New branding flow tests passed for:
  - payload validation (`400 VALIDATION_ERROR`);
  - provider generation and persistence on event metadata;
  - retry + fallback strategy and standardized `502` error when fallback is disabled.
