# Story 1.3: Admin Authentication Foundation

## Status
Draft

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As an admin user**,  
**I want secure login and protected admin session handling**,  
**so that only authorized users can manage platform content**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Login endpoint validates credentials and returns secure auth context.
2. Protected routes reject unauthenticated requests.
3. Auth failure scenarios return standardized errors.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1) Login endpoint validates credentials and returns secure auth context
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2) Protected routes reject unauthenticated requests
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3) Auth failure scenarios return standardized errors
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 3

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Use previous completed story notes when available. For this planning batch, no implementation carry-over is required.

### Data Models
- Use the domain entities from architecture shards when applicable to this story.
