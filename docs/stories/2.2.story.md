# Story 2.2: Event Visual and Hero Configuration

## Status
Done

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As an admin**,  
**I want to configure visual metadata for event presentation**,  
**so that each launch can be branded and differentiated**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Event form supports hero text and visual style configuration fields.
2. Stored visual configuration is retrievable through event APIs.
3. Validation prevents malformed style payloads.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1) Event form supports hero text and visual style configuration fields
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2) Stored visual configuration is retrievable through event APIs
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3) Validation prevents malformed style payloads
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 3

### Completion Notes List
- Added optional `hero` metadata fields (`title`, `subtitle`, `ctaText`) to event create/update payloads.
- Added optional `visualStyle` metadata fields (`backgroundColor`, `textColor`, `accentColor`) to event create/update payloads.
- Enforced strict validation for hero/style objects and hex color format.
- Ensured hero/style metadata is persisted and returned through event list and mutation responses.
- Added integration coverage for valid visual payload and malformed style rejection.
