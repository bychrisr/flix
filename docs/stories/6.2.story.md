# Story 6.2: Repository Layer and Persistence Contracts

## Status
Review

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a** backend engineer,  
**I want** domain services to use repository interfaces,  
**so that** persistence implementation can evolve without breaking API behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Repository contracts are defined for all core entities.
2. In-memory access logic is replaced by repository-backed service implementations.
3. Core service unit/integration tests validate behavior parity with previous API contracts.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1) Repository contracts are defined for all core entities.
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2) In-memory access logic is replaced by repository-backed service implementations.
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3) Core service unit/integration tests validate behavior parity with previous API contracts.
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 3

### Agent Model Used
GPT-5 Codex (CLI)

### Debug Log References
- No dedicated debug log file generated for this story.

### Completion Notes List
- Added repository contracts for event, lesson, material, and quiz domains.
- Added in-memory repository adapters and centralized repository factory.
- Refactored event, lesson, material, and quiz services to consume repository contracts instead of direct in-memory maps.
- Updated app bootstrap to wire repositories explicitly into domain services.
- Executed full API integration suite to validate contract parity.
