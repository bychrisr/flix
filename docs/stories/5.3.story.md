# Story 5.3: Operational Logging and KPI Event Hooks

## Status
Draft

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a product owner**,  
**I want baseline observability and KPI instrumentation points**,  
**so that we can monitor usage and define success thresholds iteratively**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Critical events (auth, lesson access, quiz completion) emit structured logs.
2. KPI hook points are implemented for later metric thresholds.
3. Errors in critical flows are traceable with request context.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1) Critical events (auth, lesson access, quiz completion) emit structured logs
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2) KPI hook points are implemented for later metric thresholds
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3) Errors in critical flows are traceable with request context
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 3

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Use previous completed story notes when available. For this planning batch, no implementation carry-over is required.

### Data Models
- Use the domain entities from architecture shards when applicable to this story.

### API Specifications
- Follow REST contracts and endpoint boundaries from API specification shards.
  [Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md#API Specification]

### File Locations
- Respect monorepo boundaries (`apps/web`, `apps/admin`, `services/api`, `packages/design-system`).

### Technical Constraints
- Keep implementation aligned with selected stack and architecture patterns.

## Testing
- Follow test pyramid and organization from architecture testing strategy.
  [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#Testing Strategy]
- Add/update unit tests for new business logic.
- Add/update integration tests for modified API flows when applicable.
- Ensure critical journey impact is considered for E2E smoke coverage.
