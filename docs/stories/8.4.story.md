## Status
Review

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@po"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a** product owner,  
**I want** final compliance mapping and lifecycle closure,  
**so that** all MVP requirements and stories are formally complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. FR/NFR coverage matrix maps each requirement to implementation and validation evidence.
2. Remaining open blockers/risks are documented with final go/no-go rationale.
3. Story lifecycle is closed with all relevant stories moved from Review to Done.

- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1) FR/NFR coverage matrix maps each requirement to implementation and validation evidence.
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2) Remaining open blockers/risks are documented with final go/no-go rationale.
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3) Story lifecycle is closed with all relevant stories moved from Review to Done.
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 3

### Completion Notes List
- Created complete FR/NFR coverage matrix with implementation and validation evidence for FR1..FR21 and NFR1..NFR11.
- Created final compliance closure document with:
  - final go/no-go rationale,
  - open blockers section,
  - residual risks and mitigations,
  - validation snapshot and lifecycle closure summary.
- Closed story lifecycle by moving all stories `1.1` to `8.3` from `Review` to `Done`.
- Aligned release documentation with final gate commands and closure state.
