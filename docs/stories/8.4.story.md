# Story 8.4: Final Compliance Closure and Story Lifecycle Completion

## Status
Draft

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@po"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a** product owner,  
**I want** final compliance mapping and lifecycle closure,  
**so that** all MVP requirements and stories are formally complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. FR/NFR coverage matrix maps each requirement to implementation and validation evidence.
2. Remaining open blockers/risks are documented with final go/no-go rationale.
3. Story lifecycle is closed with all relevant stories moved from Review to Done.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1) FR/NFR coverage matrix maps each requirement to implementation and validation evidence.
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2) Remaining open blockers/risks are documented with final go/no-go rationale.
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3) Story lifecycle is closed with all relevant stories moved from Review to Done.
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 3
