# Story 6.4: Data Integrity and Regression Guardrails

## Status
Review

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@qa"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As a** product owner,  
**I want** regression protection around persistence migration,  
**so that** existing completed flows remain stable after storage refactor.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Integration suite covers critical admin and learner journeys against persistent storage.
2. Data integrity checks validate key constraints/relationships in runtime.
3. Migration from previous baseline does not regress accepted API contracts.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1 (AC: 1) Integration suite covers critical admin and learner journeys against persistent storage.
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [x] Task 2 (AC: 2) Data integrity checks validate key constraints/relationships in runtime.
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3) Migration from previous baseline does not regress accepted API contracts.
  - [x] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [x] Add validation/tests for AC 3
