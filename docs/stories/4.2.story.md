## Status
Draft

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story

**I want to view and download available lesson materials**,  
**so that I can use supporting documents during study**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Materials list is visible for released lessons.
2. Download links resolve to valid files.
3. Access respects lesson availability rules.
