# Story 2.1: Event CRUD and Listing

## Status
Draft

## Executor Assignment
executor: "@dev"
quality_gate: "@architect"
quality_gate_tools: ["manual-review"]

## Story
**As an admin**,  
**I want to create and manage events**,  
**so that I can define distinct course launches and their metadata**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Admin can create, update, list, and delete events.
2. Event uniqueness constraints (e.g., slug) are enforced.
3. Event activation state is represented and editable.
4. Event visibility (`public` or `private`) is represented and editable.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1) Admin can create, update, list, and delete events
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 1
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 1
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2) Event uniqueness constraints (e.g., slug) are enforced
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 2
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 2
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3) Event activation state is represented and editable
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 3
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 3
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 4) Event visibility (`public` or `private`) is represented and editable
  - [ ] Implement technical changes required for AC 4
  - [ ] Add validation/tests for AC 4

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
- Use previous completed story notes when available. For this planning batch, no implementation carry-over is required.

### Data Models
- Use the domain entities from architecture shards when applicable to this story.

### File Locations
- Respect monorepo boundaries (`apps/web`, `apps/admin`, `services/api`, `packages/design-system`).
