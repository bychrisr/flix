### Debug Log References
- No dedicated debug log file generated for this story.

### Completion Notes List
- Added admin-protected snapshot endpoint at `/api/admin/dashboard/operational-snapshot`.
- Implemented totals for events and lessons based on in-memory services.
- Implemented lesson release distribution baseline with `upcoming`, `available`, `expired`.
- Ensured metrics are sourced from API service layer and protected by admin auth middleware.
- Added integration coverage for unauthorized access and snapshot payload correctness.
